This dashboard was designed to provide comprehensive insights into app categories, developer performance, and market trends across the app ecosystem. By leveraging this dashboard, stakeholders can explore critical metrics such as file size, top-performing developers, and category-specific trends for both free and paid apps.

Key Components:
Distribution of Categories by File Size: I created this bar chart to offer a quick visual reference of how different app categories compare in terms of average file size. Categories like Games, Music, and Education tend to have the largest file sizes, giving us insight into the data and media demands of these types of apps. This helps product managers understand infrastructure requirements and potential download barriers for certain app categories.

Top 10 Developers Based on Appearances in the Top 100 List: This chart is focused on developer performance. By ranking developers based on the frequency and number of their apps in the top 100, stakeholders can quickly identify key players in the app market. I included this section to highlight which developers are dominating the app marketplace, particularly those who excel in multiple categories like 2K.

Distribution of Top Free/Paid Apps by Category: In this section, I visualized the distribution of apps by free and paid categories. The dual bar chart format makes it easy to compare how different app categories, such as Finance and Lifestyle, perform in terms of paid vs. free models. This helps marketing teams and product strategists align monetization strategies with consumer behavior trends in each category.

App Category Trends Over the Year: To provide a dynamic view of app performance, I developed a line graph that tracks several key metrics—Price, Max File Size, and Average Rank—over time. This section allows for trend analysis across categories like Business, Games, and Social Networking, helping product teams anticipate seasonal shifts or trends within app categories.

Interactive Filters: I integrated filters on the right side of the dashboard to allow users to customize their analysis based on category, file size, and rank. This makes the dashboard adaptable for a wide range of use cases, from strategic planning to operational efficiency.

Purpose:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive and user-friendly view of key app metrics, making it an invaluable tool for decision-makers looking to optimize their strategies in a competitive app ecosystem. By visualizing developer rankings, app category distributions, and trends over time, this tool empowers teams to make data-driven decisions and enhance app performance and monetization strategies.
